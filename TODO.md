# TODO list

* Auto detect game based on network behavior and set the Settings game flag at run time
* Make a generic button class with callback to run when button is pushed - for now a quick n dirty solution is used

* Make a config option to define a set of displaystates to be enabled for scrolling through
* Make a connection timeout setting, that'll try to reconnect if the connections drops
* Make Assetto Version
